# NodeCurse-1
    Repository created for study and fun reasons
## What is this?
It's a project where notes are stored using JSON files that I work on from time to time.

**It is still in development**, here you will find how to export and import modules, use of node core libraries, node package manager and own functions seen as a module.

If you'd like to take a look at it and have any suggestions, feel free to do so.
### How to run it?
To run this project, remember to install the dependencies using the "*npm install*" command.

When i finished the development i will write the commands here...

For now if you clone the repository, the only commands that will work will be the add command, which can be run with the following command "**node app.js add --title="Here the title of the note" -- body="Here the body of the note"**" also note that it should be in the root of the "*notes-app*" directory
